    "### **Chapter 5.1: Model Predictive Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce model predictive control (MPC), a powerful and widely used framework for solving constrained optimal control problems in both linear and nonlinear systems. Unlike ILQR, which computes a complete open-loop policy offline, MPC solves a finite-horizon optimal control problem (OCP) at each time step, using the current system state as the initial condition. Only the first control input of the optimized sequence is applied before the horizon shifts forward and the process repeats — a concept known as receding horizon control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by motivating the use of MPC in comparison to open-loop OCP formulations, emphasizing its ability to incorporate feedback. The first part of this chapter focuses on linear MPC (LMPC), where we demonstrate how to reformulate the control problem into a quadratic program (QP), implement the controller, and explore how the horizon and the terminal components affect the LMPC performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part, we extend this formulation to nonlinear MPC (NMPC) by leveraging state-of-the-art OCP solvers such as Acados, and walk through the key components of an NMPC pipeline: from solver setup to closed-loop control. Finally, we provide a comparative study between NMPC and classical controllers, like ILQR, highlighting MPC's advantage in handling constraints. We conclude by discussing how key hyperparameters, particularly the prediction horizon, affect the performance and computational cost of MPC.\n",

    "From the perspective of optimal control, the choice of the norm directly shapes the optimal control policy:\n",

    "- The $l_1$-norm penalizes the absolute sum of control inputs, which **promotes sparsity** in the solution. As shown in the input plot, the controller generates long intervals of zero or constant control, applying input only when necessary. This is often desirable when **minimizing actuator usage or energy consumption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The $l_2$-norm, being quadratic and smooth, encourages **smooth and distributed control effort over time**. This leads to continuous acceleration profiles and naturally shaped velocity responses. It is commonly used due to its strong mathematical properties (e.g., uniqueness, differentiability) and **robustness to noise**.\n",

However, the second limitation is far more critical: during actual controller deployment, model mismatch and unavoidable disturbances are almost always present.\n",

    "To illustrate how such uncertainties can degrade the performance of open-loop control, we present a representative example that highlights the vulnerability of open-loop policies under real-world deviations from the nominal model:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\\) Use the dynamics from the **flat case (case 1)** to design the open-loop optimal controller: the discrete dynamics model used in the controller is derived from the cart dynamics on a flat ground, which is the same as `controller_ocp_2n`.\n",

By setting a relatively small amplitude, we aim to simulate minor perturbations commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By designing the controller and performing the simulation in different environments, we are able to simulate disturbances that are unknown at the time of controller design, as would be the case in the real world. This allows us to assess the robustness of the controller under model mismatch and unexpected variations. Please run the simulation and observe the results."

Within each individual MPC problem, a separate index $i$ is introduced to represent the steps along the prediction horizon at time $k$.

In such cases, actuator-level clipping leads to saturation, causing the actual control trajectory to deviate from the ideal one. Nevertheless, thanks to the global convergence property of linear systems, the controller still manages to reach the target state, albeit with noticeable delays.\n",

    "The simulation results reveal that, in this case, the ILQR-controlled system fails to be stabilized around the target state. This failure arises from the fact that equilibrium points in nonlinear systems generally do not exhibit global convergence. When actuator saturation occurs — typically due to clipping beyond the input bounds — the system trajectory may become trapped in an unstable region, rendering the controller ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, NMPC explicitly incorporates input and state constraints into the optimization process, thereby avoiding unexpected saturation. Although the NMPC controller is subject to the same input constraints, it is able to leverage trajectory prediction over a finite horizon to plan ahead. Instead of attempting to reach the top in a single move—which is infeasible due to the limited input—it intentionally generates a control sequence that builds up momentum over time. This can be observed from the fact that the cart reaches a higher velocity when passing the starting point for the second time. As a result, despite the input limitations, the cart successfully climbs to the top after two rounds of back-and-forth motion, demonstrating the planner’s ability to exploit system dynamics over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "  1) Prediction horizon $N$: A shorter prediction horizon reduces computation time per cycle, improving real-time compatibility, but may result in suboptimal or overly reactive behavior due to the limited foresight. A longer horizon allows the controller to anticipate future states more effectively, often producing smoother or more optimal trajectories, but at the cost of increased computational load and longer computation time per cycle;\n",
    "\n",
    "  2) Sampling frequency $f$: A higher sampling frequency (i.e., smaller sampling time) enables faster control updates and can predict the behavior of the high-frequency system dynamics more accurately, leading to better control performance, especially in fast systems. However, it increases the computational burden due to more frequent updates. Conversely, a lower sampling frequency reduces computational demand but may degrade performance or even destabilize the system if the controller cannot react sufficiently fast;\n",
    "\n",
    "  3) Weighting matrices $\\boldsymbol{Q}$, $\\boldsymbol{R}$, and $\\boldsymbol{Q}_f$: These matrices define the relative importance of state tracking versus control effort in the cost function. $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ penalizes deviation from desired states, $\\boldsymbol{R}$ penalizes excessive or aggressive control inputs, and $\\boldsymbol{Q}_f$ defines the terminal state penalty, encouraging the system to reach the final desired state smoothly. As in LQR, tuning these matrices allows you to balance tracking accuracy and control smoothness or energy efficiency."

    "##### **Results Analysis: System Response Under Different Horizon Lengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the defined task, while keeping the value of all other hyperparameters fixed, we vary the value of $N$ to represent short, medium, and long horizon cases. From the experimental results, the following trends can be observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short prediction horizon** ($N = 20$):  \n",
    "   - Under this condition, the car is unable to reach the target position. Instead, after a brief oscillation, it comes to rest at the bottom of the valley;  \n",
    "   - This outcome arises because, within the current prediction horizon (20 steps at 20 Hz, i.e., 1 second), the presence of input constraints makes it impossible to reach the goal even under a bang-bang control strategy. Consequently, the MPC prioritizes minimizing the penalty term on input, leading to a zero-input solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medium prediction horizon** ($N = 60$):  \n",
    "   - In this scenario, the car begins by moving backward, undergoes cycles of back-and-forth motion with increasing amplitude, and then propels itself toward the top, successfully reaching the target location;\n",
    "   - This behavior arises because, in the underactuated case, the car is unable to generate sufficient input to reach the top in a single ascent. However, when the prediction horizon is sufficiently long, the system can perform periodic back-and-forth motions to accumulate additional momentum. Once enough kinetic energy has been gained, the car is able to propel itself to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Long prediction horizon** ($N = 100$):  \n",
    "   - In this case, compared to the medium prediction horizon scenario, the car requires fewer cycles to accumulate enough momentum accumulation to reach the top;\n",
    "   - This is because, compared to the case with N=60, the prediction horizon with N=100 covers a longer time interval. Specifically, N=60 corresponds to a prediction window of 3s (60 steps at 20 Hz), while the transient behavior in this case lasts approximately 4 seconds, as observed from the simulation results. As a result, at the start of the optimization, the MPC cannot foresee the car reaching the top, and thus chooses a strategy involving more cycles of momentum accumulation. \n",
    "   - On the other hand, with N=100, the prediction horizon spans 5 seconds. Therefore, the prediction horizon fully encompasses the transient behavior, allowing the MPC to effectively optimize over approximately the whole timeline. As a result, the computed control sequence can be regarded as a near-optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Main Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the length of the prediction horizon significantly influences the system's ability to generate effective control strategies. A short horizon limits the controller's foresight, leading to suboptimal or even ineffective behavior. In contrast, a sufficiently long horizon allows the MPC to anticipate the full transient dynamics and compute near-optimal control actions. Therefore, selecting an appropriate horizon length is critical for achieving desired performance in MPC design.\n",
