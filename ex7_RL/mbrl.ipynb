    "## Discretization I\n",
    "### **Discretizing State and Input Spaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov decision process (MDP), is the main assumption in RL. An MDP is the tuple $(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{U}, p, r)$, where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the discrete set of states, $\\mathcal{U}$ is the discrete set of actions (can be state-dependent), $p$ describes the transition probabilities (conditional probability on the next state $x'$ given a state $x$ and an action $u$: $p(x' \\vert x, u)$), and $r$ represents the reward for each transition with $r(x, u, x')$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many real-world problems (e.g., in robotics) have continuous state and action spaces or a mix of continuous and discrete spaces. In this section, we discuss the discretization of the state and input spaces. Then we will show how we compute the transition probabilities and rewards based on these discrete sets. We highlight two approaches: the nearest neighbor approach and the linear interpolation approach. Both approaches yield a stochastic MDP, that is, typically $p(x' \\vert x, u) \\leq 1$ for any $x'$, $x$, and $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of the discretization plays an important role. Typically, a finer discretization will lead to more accurate results that more closely represent the underlying continuous-time system. However, any additional discretization will lead to increased computation time. This computation scales poorly for higher dimensional state and action spaces (referred to as the curse of dimensionality). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we choose a uniform discretization of states and inputs. However, we do make sure that the discrete states and actions exactly include the target state. In practice you may also consider using non-uniform discretizations, where the discretization steps vary. We show the discretization of the state and action spaces next. "
