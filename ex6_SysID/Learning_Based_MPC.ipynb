    "### **Chapter 6.2: Learning-based Model Predictive Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce the motivation and structure of learning-based model predictive control (MPC) under uncertainty. When the true system dynamics are unknown or difficult to model exactly, we rely on data-driven approaches to build approximate models and design robust controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by setting up a bumpy terrain case as the simulation environment, and specifying all task parameters. This provides a unified testbed for comparing different control strategies. Then we provide auxiliary functions for basis generation and symbolic model construction. These tools are essential for flexible model learning and controller synthesis. Based on all these preparations, we can develop different controllers and run the simulation according to different level of prior knowledges we know about the real environment, which proceeds through several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline 1:** Simulate MPC designed with the true model (bumpy case) to establish a baseline for performance benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline 2:** Simulate MPC designed with a mismatched model (flat case) and compare with the first example to illustrate the impact of model mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deterministic learning:** Collect data, identify a deterministic model using **Linear Regression**, and simulate MPC designed with the learned model to demonstrate data-driven control without uncertainty quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probabilistic learning (Robust MPC):** Assume a mismatched model (flat case) and uncertainty bounds and implement **robust MPC (RMPC)** to handle model uncertainty conservatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probabilistic learning (Bayesian):** Collect data, identify a probabilistic model using **Bayesian Linear Regression**, and simulate **Learning-based MPC (LBMPC)** with uncertainty quantification, enabling constraint tightening and risk-aware control.\n",

Specifically, we assume that the real testbed is a bumpy terrain $h(p) = k \\cdot \\cos(18 p)$ (as case 3 defined before), but as a controller designer, you do not know the exact profile of the terrain. Instead, you are aware that there is some uncertainty in the system dynamics, and your goal is to design controllers that can handle this uncertainty effectively.\n",

We demonstrate how to use linear regression with carefully chosen basis functions to identify the terrain profile, and then synthesize an MPC controller based on the learned model.

This dataset serves as the basis for model identification. To flexibly approximate the unknown terrain profile, we select a set of basis functions consisting of trigonometric terms—specifically sine and cosine functions with frequencies ranging from 16 to 20—and include a constant offset. Polynomial terms are excluded to better capture the periodic nature of the terrain. Using a standard Linear Regression (LR) approach, we fit the collected data to these basis functions, yielding a deterministic approximation of the terrain. Finally, this learned model is embedded into the MPC framework and evaluated in the true environment to assess its closed-loop performance.\n",

However, due to the presence of the robust invariant tube, the true state is only guaranteed to stay within a neighborhood around the nominal trajectory. Since the stabilizing feedback controller was designed based on the flat terrain dynamics, it may not generate sufficient corrective inputs on the actual sloped terrain to drive the true state exactly to the target. As a result, we observe a steady-state error in the true trajectory.

    "Compared to RMPC, LBMPC accurately reaches the target state, whereas RMPC only stabilizes within a neighborhood due to its conservative design. This performance gap arises because RMPC is based on a flat terrain model and fails to generate enough thrust to overcome the slope. In contrast, LBMPC captures the slope profile through Bayesian learning, enabling more informed predictions and tighter control actions. As a result, LBMPC achieves lower steady-state error and more efficient input usage under the same constraints.\n",
