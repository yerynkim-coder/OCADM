    "### **Mountain Car Problem: Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The mountain car problem is a classical control problem that illustrates the dynamics of a car moving on a profile. This problem is influenced by gravity, the profile's inclination, and an applied acceleration input, as depicted in the figure below. Our primary objective is to design a control policy using various methods (e.g. LQR, MPC, and RL) to drive the car from an initial state $x_0$ to a predefined terminal state $x_T$, all while being subject to constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Illustration of a mountain car problem](../figure/MountainCarIllustration.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Variations of the Mountain Car Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The mountain car problem can be set up in different ways to study various aspects of this control problem and can be divided into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. **Type of Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terminal State Reaching**: The classic setting where the car must reach a target state (e.g., the hilltop) as quickly or efficiently as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stabilization**: The goal is to stabilize the car at a designated equilibrium point **(the focus of this Jupyter Notebook series)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trajectory Tracking**: The car is required to follow a predefined trajectory over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-Optimal Control**: The focus is on minimizing the number of time steps to reach the target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. **Type of Dynamics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous-time Dynamics**: Systems whose states evolve continuously over time, typically modeled by differential equations such as $\\dot{x}(t)=f_c(x(t),u(t))$, where $x(t)$ and $u(t)$ are the the state and input at time $t$, respectively, and $f_c$ are the continuous-time system dynamics. The dynamic equations derived from first principles or Newton's laws are continuous-time dynamic equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete-time Dynamics**: Systems whose states evolve at distinct time steps, typically modeled by difference equations such as $x_{k+1}=f(x_k,u_k)$, where $x_k$ and $u_k$ are the the state and input at step $k$, respectively, and $f$ are the discrete-time system dynamics. Due to the discrete nature of computer systems, we need to implement controllers in a discrete-time fashion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Dynamics**: the future behavior of the system depends linearly on its current state and input, typically expressed as $\\dot{x}=Ax+Bu$, Where $A$ is the system matrix and $B$ is the input matrix. Always used for simplified analysis or as a local approximation near equilibrium points. For example the car moving along a flat ground or a slope with constant inclination angle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonlinear Dynamics**: the general case that captures the nonlinear evolution of the system dynamcis, typically expressed as $\\dot{x}=f(x,u)$. Especially introducing the gravitational effects and nonlinear terrain profiles, making the problem significantly harder to solve but also more realistic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. **Type of State and Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous State / Input**: the state or input variables can take any value within a continuous range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete State / Input**: the state or input variables can only take values from a countable set, often finite or indexed by integers. A general example of discrete state space together with discrete input space  is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unconstrained State / Input**:  the state or input variables are free to take any value, which means $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\boldsymbol{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constrained State / Input**:  the state or input variables are restricted to lie within specified bounds or satisfy certain conditions, reflecting physical or actuator limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These variations enable researchers and practitioners to explore a broad spectrum of control strategies, from classical methods (e.g., PID, LQR) to modern techniques (e.g., MPC, reinforcement learning), under diverse dynamics and objectives.\n",

    "As introduced at the beginning, optimal control problems come in many variations. The control inputs can be either continuous or discrete, and the problems may involve constraints or be unconstrained. In this section, we extend our symbolic DP implementation to handle **discrete-valued control inputs**, also known as **bang-bang control**. Unlike the previous continuous-input case, where the optimal control input was computed by analytically minimizing the cost function using calculus (first-order optimality conditions), here we **explicitly enumerate** all possible control actions (in this case: $ u_k \\in \\{-0.5, 0.5\\} $) and choose the one with the **lowest resulting cost**. The differences comparing with the previous continuous input DP are summarized as follows:\n",

Instead of analytically minimizing the total cost by solving first-order conditions (as in the continuous case), we now **explicitly evaluate the cost-to-go under each possible input value** from the discrete control set. In this bang-bang setting, the input $ u_k $ is constrained to the values $-0.5$ and $+0.5$.\n",

    "From the simulation results, it can be observed that this control strategy is still capable of driving the Mountain Car system to successfully complete the task. However, from the intermediate printed outputs during the backward recursion, it becomes evident that the computation time per step grows exponentially. When the recursion depth reaches $k=4$, the time required for solving the last step already reaches approximately $40$ minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, from the final plot of the derived policy expressions, it is clear that the complexity of the expressions increases significantly as the recursion proceeds. This phenomenon occurs because the number of possible system evolutions grows exponentially with the number of steps. For instance, if the control input $u$ is selected from a discrete set such that $u_k \\in \\{-0.5, 0.5\\}$, and the total time horizon is discretized into $N$ steps, then the optimal policy computed at the final iteration would involve evaluating up to $2^N$ different cases.\n",
